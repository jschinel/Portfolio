        <p id = "controls"><b>CONTROLS ENGINEER</b><br></br>  
            I have a very extensive background with PLC controls primarily using Allen Bradley (RS-Logix 500 / 5000), TIA portal (V13-V17), Simatic S7 and Fanuc robotics. Typically the machines i programmed would consist of 100-200 remote I/0 and have between 5-15 servo motors using S120 drives for siemens and kinetix 5700 drives for AB (Also used kinetix 6000 and 6500). 
        </p>
        <p id = "electricaltech"><b>ELECTRICAL TECHNICIAN</b><br></br>
            Of course with all aspects of the controls or electrical engineering field one must have a hands on knowledge in order to design a product. For me i have been doing panel wiring, extensive electrical diagnostics and machine installation wiring for atleast 8 years. Although it can challenging at times i throughly enjoy solving any circuit problems.

        <p id = "electricaleng"><b>ELECTRICAL ENGINEER</b><br></br>
            Although i have only 1-2 years of electrical engineering i have learned a tremendous amount. Not only in theoretical calculations but with overall design standards and practices. Most of my experience has been using E-Plan but i have done some engineering using Auto-CAD. During my short stint of designed i have taken course giving me certificates for UL standard and E-plan.</p>
        <p id = "softwaredevelop"><b>SOFTWARE DEVELOPER</b><br></br>
            The newest addition to my knowledge base!! Software development has always peaked my interest and I am excited to say that i am now enrolled at GA (General Assembly) in a accelerated course learning front-end, back-end and full-stack development. Actually this website you are on is my first attempt at making my persona website. Hope you like it!</p>
